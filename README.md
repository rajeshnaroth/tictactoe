# TIC-TAC-TOE
A simple, responsive tic tac toe game using react/redux and bootstrap

####Step 1: First, you will need to install node, npm and webpack
Install node from https://nodejs.org. This will also install npm

    npm install webpack -g
    npm install webpack-dev-server -g (optional)

####Step 2: Install all the required node modules

    npm install

####Step 3. Package application

	webpack

####Step 4. Run the express server

    npm start
    open http://localhost:9000/ #This is where your app is running

###For those who are starting new
You will need to install git. I recommend using brew.
Install brew from http://brew.sh/
Your computer will ask to install Xcode if you donâ€™t have it already. Install it.
Once brew is installed, run:

    brew install git

cd to your projects folder:

    git clone https://github.com/rajeshnaroth/tictactoe.git
    cd tictactoe
    npm install
    webpack
    npm start
    open http://localhost:9000/

##### Karma tests are stubs only. This was more of an exercise in figuring out react/redux
